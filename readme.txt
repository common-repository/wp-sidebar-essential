Like the Text widget, but also allows working PHP code and shortcode to be inserted.

== Description ==

The normal Text widget allows you to insert arbitrary Text and/or HTML code. 
This allows that too, but also parses any inserted Shortcode and PHP code and executes smoothly. 

All Shortcode must be enclosed in the standard [ and ] tags for it to be 
recognized.
All PHP code must be enclosed in the standard <?php and ?> tags for it to be 
recognized.

1. Upload `wp-sidebar-essential.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use the widget like any other widget.
